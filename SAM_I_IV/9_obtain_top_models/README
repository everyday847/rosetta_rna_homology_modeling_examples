# To obtain the top ten best-scoring models from each simulation, we execute 
# the following Python script. (Note that since the included output 'silent 
# files' only have 50 models each, this represents a MUCH larger fraction of
# the generated models than intended, so the results will not be well 
# converged! Ideally, extract ten models from a large simulation as described 
# above.)
