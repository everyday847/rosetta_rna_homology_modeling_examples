# Because of the large architectural disparity between the SAM I and SAM I/IV
# riboswitches, we cannot thread-and-minimize the entire scaffold before 
# culling undesired residues (as in the adenine riboswitch case). Instead, we
# must cull and renumber first, then thread and minimize.
# 
# With a text editor, we take 2ygh.pdb and remove all residues except:
#
# A:6-14 A:41-48 A:55-60 A:86-88
#
# We rename the resulting structure to starting_puzzle8_chunk.pdb.
#
# Additional residues from the P1 helix may be retained -- an additional two
# base pairs -- and this might be a particularly good idea for SWM simulations,
# which will increase substantially in expense due to four extra nucleotides
# to sample even though their conformations are fairly certain.
#
# Next, assuming we've stuck with this portion -- identical to the "red part" in
# Fig. 4 -- we thread on the correct sequence, which involves only one point
# mutation in a loop and one GC => GU base pair.
#
rna_thread -s starting_puzzle8_chunk.pdb -seq aucacgagcggcaaccggugcugau

# and renumber the resulting structure:
#
cp threaded.pdb threaded_renumbered.pdb
renumber_pdb_in_place.py threaded_renumbered.pdb A:3-10 A:21-28 A:45-50 A:67-69
