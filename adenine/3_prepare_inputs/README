# If a native structure has already been determined and you are testing the 
# validity of this method (or your own extension to it), then you can use the
# native structure and a Rosetta python script:
#
# pdb2fasta.py 4tzy_target.pdb > target.fasta
#
# If you are in an actual blind modeling situation, there is no native, so you
# are able to create the fasta yourself, with whatever chain letter and 
# residue numbering you prefer.

# Determine what residues need to be rebuilt; in this particular case, they are
# X:26, X:31, X:39, X:44, X:62, and X:74. In theory a clever command line using
# sed could probably do the trick, but we've always found it slightly more
# comfortable and certain to use a text editor.
