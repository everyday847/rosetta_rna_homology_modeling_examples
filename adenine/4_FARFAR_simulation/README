# This command will generate 50 structures. The plots in the manuscript for 
# this target are based on ~5000 structures, so you may wish to run 10 
# simulations in parallel. You can easily set that up by using this very
# README file:
#
# rosetta_submit.py README FARFAR 100 48 -save_logs
#
# will create a directory structure:
#
# ./FARFAR/0
# ./FARFAR/1
# ...
# ./FARFAR/99
#
# as well as separate files to execute the below command line in each of those
# subdirectories. These files may be executed via bash *or* submitted to 
# either PBS or slurm queueing systems with the specified time limit, 48 hours.
#
# Once the simulations are over (or, really, in the middle to check on them)
# you can run
#
# easy_cat.py FARFAR
#
# to concatenate the output "silent files" into a single file
#
# ./farna_rebuild.out
